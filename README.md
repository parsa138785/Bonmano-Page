# Getting Started

This project is built using React and Vite. To get started with running the application locally, please follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the terminal).

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized files for deployment.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that you have a stable internet connection as some dependencies may need to be fetched from the web.
- If you encounter any issues, please check the console for error messages and refer to the documentation of the respective libraries.
